# Flood analysis using Sentinel 2 data and MNDWI in Google Earth Engine

In this project I apply modified normalized difference water index on Sentinel 2 imagery to detect flooding in Piura Province, Peru. I then carry out an indepth analysis of the damage caused by the floods to people and crops. Agricultural areas are the most affected in the province with over 877 hectares of cropland flooded. Thousands of people are exposed and displaced by the flood water.
